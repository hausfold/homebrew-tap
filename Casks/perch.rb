  # The version/sha256 lines above are CI-owned: perch's release workflow
  # rewrites them on every date-versioned tag (hausfold/perch, release.yml) and
  # pushes here over a deploy key. Hand-edit only to bootstrap.
  #
  # BOOTSTRAP: perch has not been released yet, so version + sha256 are
  # placeholders (the release URL 404s until then). The first `bench release
  # perch` stamps a real v<date> tag; CI's bump-tap sed replaces both quoted
  # lines with the released zip's version + hash.
